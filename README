rcsm
----

A tiny service manager written in rc.
It doesnt really do much, appart from launching and killing services.
So no logging, no monitoring, just start/stop.

It follows the same concept as shsm[0], but is about half the LOCs.


Install
-------

	$ make install

Usage
-----

Create neccessary directories

	$ rcsm -c 

Now create your service scripts
To start/stop your services with rcsm

	$ rcsm -s foo
	$ rcsm -k foo

If you have multiple services you want to run, you can activate them

	$ rcsm -a foo
	$ rcsm -a bar

You can now start/stop all your activated services simultaneously
	
	$ rcsm -s
	$ rcsm -k


Service scripts
---------------

Service scripts are rather simple, and only require 2 case statements (-s/-k).
this means that you can essentially use w/e language/shell you want, as long as
-s and -k options is available.
