rcsm
----

A tiny service manager written in rc.
It doesnt really do much, appart from starting and killing services.
So no logging, no monitoring, just start/stop.

It follows the same concept as shsm[0], but is about half the LOCs.


Install
-------

	$ make install


Usage
-----
rcsm [flag] [args]
-a	- Activate service.
-c  - Create neccessary directories.
-d  - Deactivate services.
-h  - Show usage message.
-k  - Kill services.
-l  - List available services.
-s  - Start services.
-r  - Restart services.

Some flags have additional functionallity when ran without arguments:
-a  - Lists activated services.
-k  - Kill all activated services.
-s  - Start all activated services.

Some flags also supports multiple arguments: -a -d -k -s -r


Service scripts
---------------
Service scripts are rather simple, and have only 2 requirements:
Accepting -s/-k flags.
Which gives users the freedom to use whichever language/shell they like for
service scripts.
